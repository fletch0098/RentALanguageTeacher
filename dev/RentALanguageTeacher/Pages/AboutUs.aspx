                    Denise has been living in Quetzaltenango since 2011. She first came to study Spanish
                    for 3 weeks, but ended up staying ever since. Thanks to her Spanish teacher Ely, she
                    now speaks Spanish fluently and wishes to help other Spanish students take advantage
                    of the great Spanish instruction here. Formerly a management consultant in Singapore,
                    she is currently owner and chef at La Esquina Asiatica, a restaurant serving delicious 
                    Asian food in Quetzaltenango.

                    Brian moved to Quetzaltenango in 2011. He too was just passing through for a few weeks of Spanish classes, but met some great people and decided to stay.
                    Many of his friends in Xela are Spanish 
                    teachers and this inspired him to help them find a way to reach out to students online. In the United States Brian held 
                    positions in Engineering and Technology, and currently he is a Technology and Mathematics teacher in Xela.
